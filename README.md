This is the GitHub repository for my contribution to the Fraud Detection group project.

It is the **Final Course Project** of SMM768 Applied Deep Learning module for 2022/23 MSc Business Analytics at Bayes Business School.

## Project Aim
- To classify insurance claims into fradulent and non-fraudulent
- To understand how to evaluate machine learning models in the context of unbalanced datasets ([Insurance_claims.csv](/data/Insurance_claims.csv))
- To evaluate models with different degrees of complexity
- To learn about the use for autoencoders to detect anomalies
- To learn how to train neural networks

## Code Explanation
- Cleaned and pre-processed the claim data ([Insurance_claims_clean.csv](/data/Insurance_claims_clean.csv))
- Trained & tested neural networks
- Plotted hit rate VS detection rate at different thresholds for different models
  - Decision Tree ([DecisionTree_dh.csv](/data/DecisionTree_dh.csv))
  - Neural Network ([NN_dh.csv](/data/NN_dh.csv))
  - Autoencoder ([Autoencoder_dh.csv](/data/Autoencoder_dh.csv))
